# AccountFucker
fucks discord accounts kinda ez

# How!?
there's an api endpoint which is not accessible to user accounts\
so, if you grab someone's token you can "ban" his account\
thus, it grabs the token, logs into the account, picks a random guild, and requests /api/v8/guilds/theguildid/members which is not accessible to users
